  // faq
  faqs: [
    {
      id: 'f1',
      question: 'What crane capacities and types does KR Brothers operate?',
      answer:
        'Our fleet covers Hydra cranes, hydraulic mobile cranes, truck-mounted and rough-terrain cranes, typically ranging from 12 tonnes up to 100 tonnes. We also arrange higher-capacity or specialist equipment through our equipment network when a job demands it. The exact machine is always chosen after checking the load weight, working radius, boom length and ground conditions — because picking the wrong class of crane is what causes most lifting failures on site.',
    },
    {
      id: 'f2',
      question: 'Do you provide crane services in Mukerian, Hajipur and neighbouring districts?',
      answer:
        'Yes. We are based at Vill. Khizarpur (Hajipur), Teh. Mukerian in Distt. Hoshiarpur, which puts us right in the middle of the Mukerian–Hajipur–Hoshiarpur industrial belt. Our regular working area covers Mukerian, Hajipur, Hoshiarpur, Pathankot, Dasuya, Garhshankar, Sultanpur Lodhi, Phillaur and Jalandhar, and we regularly travel into Kangra and the Jammu corridor in Himachal Pradesh.',
    },
    {
      id: 'f3',
      question: 'How quickly can equipment be mobilised for emergency lifting or breakdown jobs?',
      answer:
        'For emergencies inside the Hoshiarpur and Mukerian belt we can usually have a Hydra or mobile crane rolling within 1 to 3 hours of your call, subject to machine availability and road conditions. For planned jobs we ask for at least 24 to 48 hours notice so we can run the site assessment and keep the scheduled slot for you. Night, Sunday and festival shifts are available because site breakdowns rarely happen at convenient hours.',
    },
    {
      id: 'f4',
      question: 'Are your operators and cranes certified for industrial safety audits?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Our cranes carry valid fitness certificates, pollution certificates, insurance and third-party load-test records, and we can share those documents for your site audit or vendor onboarding. Our operators and riggers are trained and certified in lifting and signalling operations, and every job starts with a pre-lift plan and toolbox talk. We follow a zero-compromise safety approach — it is the reason behind our tagline, Safe Lift Strong Support.',
    },
    {
      id: 'f5',
      question: 'How can I get an instant quote?',
      answer:
        'Call us on +91 78890 87547, send a WhatsApp message to +91 97792 55878 with your load weight, site location and duration, or fill the Get a Quote form on this page. Share four things and we can usually quote back within the hour: the approximate load in tonnes, the working radius, the number of lifts or shifts needed, and the site location. If anything is not clear, our engineer will visit and assess the site before we finalise the rate.',
    },
    {
      id: 'f6',
      question: 'Do you charge mobilisation separately?',
      answer:
        'Mobilisation and demobilisation charges depend on distance and the number of shifts booked. They are always shown as a separate line in the written quotation so there are no surprises on the final invoice. On long monthly rentals or multi-shift campaigns we normally absorb or reduce the mobilisation cost — ask us for a package rate.',
    },
    {
      id: 'f7',
      question: 'Is fuel and the operator included in the rental?',
      answer:
        'On standard hire the machine, certified operator and rigger are included. Fuel is included for shifts within our regular operating radius and is charged at a transparent rate when the site lies outside it. Overtime and waiting charges are agreed in advance in the quotation so you always know how the bill is calculated.',
